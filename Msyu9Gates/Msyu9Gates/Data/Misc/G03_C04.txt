She fled. Her bare feet padded against the soft rock, cracking it as she ran.
Dust burned her eyes, but there just ahead was the portal home.
She rushed through, the world around her blurring into a haze of colors and sounds.
Then, nothing.
As she opened her eyes, the pain had faded. It was over, she was home.
She stood, alone in her room. She looked around, all of the reminders of her past lay around her.
A sudden a strange detatchment flooded over her. These weren't her things. They belonged to someone else.
Someone she no longer recognized.
Against the wall was a mirror. However, the figure staring back at her was unfamiliar.
She turned her eyes to the doorway. Only one thing now was certain.
She had to leave this place. Or... perhaps she had already left. "She" was just all that had yet to realize it.
Whatever lay beyond that door, she understood... it was her Destiny.
There had to be more than the pain she had known. The suffering, the torture.
She had to find it. She had to find herself.
As if to goad her, the house creaked. A soft rumble vibrated the walls.
A picture frame dropped from her dresser, landing face down on the floor.
She could feel it. Her window to leave closing.
Whatever she was to find on the other side of that door... It would not wait.
It could not wait.
And so, with no further hesitation, she stepped through the doorway.
