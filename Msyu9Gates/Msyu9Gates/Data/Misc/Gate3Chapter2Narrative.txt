A trick of her broken mind, she thought.

No such figure existed. She was saddened by her new reality, her imagination torturing her for it.

In silent retreat she returned to the only place she found solace. The quiet, soft embrace of her sheets. She welcomed the darkess, unaware of what it brought.

Thrust awake in the late hours, a noise permeated her surroundings.

"Come with me," a voice echoed, its source unseen.

"Who are you?" She whispered, shrinking away with her back against the wall.

"A messe n ger," it replied. "Or a guide. Take your pick."

As it spoke, a shadowy, shapeless figure drifted along on e wall of the room.

"Messengers have messages," she answered snarkly, "why are you in my room?"

"To deliever a message," i t replied sarcastically.

She stared in silence. Mocked by a nearly invisible specter.

"And this message is?" She asked finally, taking a nervous breath.

"More of an invitation," it replied again, drifting back to the otherside of the room.

Annoyed, she sighed, "an invitation to what?"

It didn't speak. A whispy arm emerged from the shadow, pointing towards an empty corner of the room.

"I...I don't get it," she stammered, her eyes darting from the corner back to the fig u re.

Silence.

"Get out," she said, raising her voice with a mix of fear and confidence. "Just... get out... leave me alone..."

It drifted closer.

"The devil you know," it whispered, "or the one you don't. Choose."

"The devil... What are you...?" She mouthed, "no such thing exists-"

"Nor do I," it shot back quickly. She could sense a smile beneath the shadow, its demeanor softening. "Come. I will show you a place where rivers of fire flow through mountains of ash, on a world far from this one. One where those who deserve pain, see no end to it."
