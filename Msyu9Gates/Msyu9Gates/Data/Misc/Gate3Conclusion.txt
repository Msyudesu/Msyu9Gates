Well done.
This ends our little test.
Gate III lies behind you, conquered. A difficult challenge, certainly.
Perhaps you've learned something about yourself... or your host.
Pay attention, for what you may find is in pieces along the way.

This is not the end of our story.
Far more difficult challenges lie ahead.
Prepare yourself.

Mind your step... and Beware of Liars.
